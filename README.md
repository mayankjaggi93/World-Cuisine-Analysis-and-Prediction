## World Cuisine Analysis and Prediction

The goal is to predict the cuisine of recipes based on its ingredients. Unique ingredients to a cuisine
and support vector classifier algorithm are used for prediction. The relationship between geographic proximity
of cuisines and common ingredients used is determined. A recommender system is developed, recommending a
cuisine to the user based on his/her ingredient preference.

The details of the project can be seen in the attached report.
